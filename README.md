# ML-Projects-Rainfall-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Rainfall Prediction** using the **Random Forest Classifier**. The dataset includes meteorological parameters such as **Day, Pressure, MaxTemp, Temperature, MinTemp, DewPoint, Humidity, Cloud, Rainfall, Sunshine, WindDirection, and WindSpeed** to predict the likelihood of rainfall. Extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed, covering **pressure distribution, max temperature distribution, temperature distribution, min temperature distribution, dewpoint distribution, humidity distribution, cloud distribution, sunshine distribution, windspeed distribution, and rainfall distribution**, along with a **correlation heatmap** to understand feature relationships. For model selection and optimization, techniques such as **train_test_split**, **GridSearchCV**, and **cross_val_score** were utilized. The **cross-validation scores** obtained were **[0.68421053, 0.81578947, 0.83783784, 0.83783784, 0.91891892]**, with a **mean cross-validation score of 0.818918918918919**. The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics like **classification_report**, **confusion_matrix**, and **accuracy_score**. This project demonstrates the powerful application of **Machine Learning in weather prediction**, improving the accuracy and reliability of **climate forecasting**.
